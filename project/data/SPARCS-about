SPARCS-about
2011 NYS Hospitalization Records Dataset

This file describes the project dataset in simple terms.  It summarizes the 
column names and their contents for the data frame that forms our workshop 
project dataset.

-------------------------------Sparcs Data------------------------------------

The SPARCS data frame contains one record for each overnight hospital stay in 
any facility found in a New York State county. It is an adaptation of the 
de-identified 2011 SPARCS dataset that is publically available from New York
State.

A query interface to this data is available on Health Data NY:
