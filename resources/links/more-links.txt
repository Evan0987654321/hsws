Visualize Academic Paper Interrelationships
	This is a visualization tool for the interrelationships between academic
	papers on ArXiv. Each paper is represented by a circle. The size of the
	circle is scaled by the number of citations, the color is related to the
	subject area, and it's searchable (enter e.g. "?a p.zoller" to search on
	one author). Click a circle to see information and links to that paper.
