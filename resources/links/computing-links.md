"A proposed program might assign federal inmates a low, moderate, or high score based on their likelihood of recidivism. Indicators of improvement...including newly acquired skills, attitude, and behavior changes over time" would determine the ratings.    

## Computation made visible: the megaprocessor

"The Megaprocessor is a micro-processor built large. Very large."

## Sequencing ancient human genomes from the Himalayas (using supercomputers)

June 2016

"The Himalayas ... are very interesting in human evolution because:

1) they represent a major barrier to gene flow, and

2) habitation of these regions required major genetic adaptations. Thus ancient DNA can illuminate the history of migration and of adaptations."

...both prehistoric individuals and contemporary Tibetan populations share beneficial mutations in two genes implicated in adaptation to low-oxygen conditions found at high altitudes.
